So far written code can:
set the initial clay point x & y locations,
determine the closest two points to the user positon, 
get the line in between the two points,
determine if the user is penetrating the clay, 
and calcualte the perpendicular penetration. 

//workspace setup
    length = usable work length
    points = number of points to be used
    lengthBetween = length / (points - 1) //distance between points
    startingDepth = y position of clay block when starting

//mass spring dampners system 
    float ymass[points] = {startingDepth}; //based on x & y axis of pantograph
    float xmass[points] = {0}; //based on x & y axis of pantograph
    use for loop to fill array with points distance lengthBetween
    float velMass[points] = {0};
    float accMass[points] = {0};
    float velMassPrev[points] =  {0};
    float accMassPrev[points] =  {0};

//calculated user x,y
    yUser = y;
    xUser = x;
    
    //velocityY calculation for user
	// Calculate filtered velocity with loop time estimation
	dyUser = (double)(yUser - yUser_prev) / 0.001;

	// Calculate the filtered velocity of the handle using an infinite impulse response filter
	dyUser_filt = .9*dyUser + 0.1*dyUser_prev; 
	
//handle case if xUser is = or surpasses min/max xMass

//find which two points will be affected
    //array containing difference between user position and all clay positions
    xdiffUserMass = xUser - xMass //create a function to do this for all elements

    //choose the clay element to interact with as
    the element with minimum xdiffUserMass //function that gets minimum value

    //find 2nd element depending on if  xUser  > or < xMass
	
//if user is >= xMax of adjacent clay
	pass to end, set flag to not process, ext

//find penetration distance  https://bobobobo.wordpress.com/2008/01/07/solving-linear-equations-ax-by-c-0/
    //calculate line equation
        //ax + by + c = 0
            //a = y1 - y2
            //b = x2 - x1
            //c = (x1 - x2) * y1 + (y2 - y1) * x1
    //calculate normal distance
        //d = abs ( a * xuser + b * yuser + c) / sqrt( a^2 + b^2 )
		
	//determine if there is penetration by finding the depth at the user height to be on the line
	//if depth is not less than this, then not inside the line
		

//calculate user applied force
    //FUserx1 = k * d * abs( xUser - x1 ) / lengthBetween) ) + b * vXUser * abs( xUser - x1 ) / lengthBetween) )
    //FUserx1 = k * d * abs( xUser - x2 ) / lengthBetween) ) + b * vXUser * abs( xUser - x1 ) / lengthBetween) )
